Wunschlistapp

## Requirements
This application uses [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) which is based on Vue.js. You might need to prepare your environment to have npm and Quasar in place.

## Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```


### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).


## Security-related information
As I don't consider a wishlist a major concern for security, I don't update the project based on security issues in the dependencies (which do exist!).
If you use the wishlist for very private data, make sure you build it yourself and call `quasar upgrade -i` before building the project.

## Questions & suggestions?
Feel free to open an issue :)
